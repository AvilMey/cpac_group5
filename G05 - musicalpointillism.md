# Abstract
Representing musical information and developing method for mapping artistic performance can be a very challenging task from a computational point of view. The goal of our CPAC final project is developing a tool able to capture the performance of a musician and to represent it in an artistic way. In this way, we obtain a visual representation where all the elements related to the artistic interpretation are organized in a meaningful fashion. Pitches are displaced in a circular way, resembling the circle of fifths, and they are represented by different shapes. Each shape is characterized by a size, which proportional to the duration of the associated note. The colors used to fill each shape are represented by the popular Tone-to-Color association from Scriabin, so that each note has its own color. The musical temporal dimension is mapped into the bidimensional space of the canvas, so the shapes expand through the canvas in both dimensions resembling the expansion of a “universe”. Following this line of reasoning, we obtain an organic evolution through time, which is meaningful to the user. Eventually, we allow the user to customize the parameters set by default. We remark the fact that the default parameters allow the generation of a “portrait” of the musical piece, allowing the user to analyse the piece from a different perspective and even compare different performances.

## Artistic vision
With this project we would like to aproach music and art in a different way to people that they have not think about before. Mostly, the part of music that is more sensible and meaningful and that, some times, it is forgotten while it should be one of the most importatn ones. The main idea is to obtain an “artistic portrait” of a musical piece, relying on strong a rationale concerning all the elements involved.

## Prototype after the hackathon
Once finished the prototype, we are expecting to develop and make work the following functionalities:
- Taking and recognising the notes coming from the piano MIDI
- Recognize the different basic parameters from the notes: duration, intensity and pitch 
- Represent them in a portrait giving them a sense to the user with what they have played

# Final project

Once we have reached this point, we can see how this prototype of our project can have a large number of additional functionalities to implement, among which we can find:
- Interface: something that we have thought that is basic for the user, would be to implement a suitable interface to make it easier to choose some basic parameters from which the portrait of the music you enter will be generated.
- Control panel
- Change of techniques: in an initial idea, we based ourselves on the pointillism style for the development of the project. However, a new functionality to implement could be to give the user the power to change the style used. For example using cubism or creating mosaics with the different elements that we will generate.
- Different distribution of the notes in the portrait getting a brand new portrait style

This is just a small number of possibilities we have in mind now, but we don't rule out the idea of adding more as we develop the project.
